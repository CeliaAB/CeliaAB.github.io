                <div class="content">
                    <p>I make ethical decisions all the time, everyday, in the way I live. It can be small things 
                    or big things, from how I behave with people to what I do or don't do in life. The outcomes are 
                    not always immediate, or measureable. By following the values of integrity, objectivity, 
                    community and fairness, and with the knowledge available at the time the decision is made, the 
                    outcome is what it is.</p>

                    <h2>My Culture and Its Influence on my Values and Identity</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>My original culture values community and what an individual can contribute, rather than the individual. 
                    My adopted culture focuses on the individual, so I am conflicted most of the time. I value the individual 
                    and what he/she represents, but not at the expense of the community around them.</p>
                    <p>In my original culture, success is defined by financial and social standing. In NZ people care about and 
                    pursue goals such as work-life balance and self-fulfilment. There is definitely a balance and sometimes 
                    you cannot have one without the other. It has moved me towards a way of approaching things, as opposed 
                    to focussing on outcomes - on "the journey" rather than "the destination".</p>

                    <h2>Impact of my Strengths and Limitations in my Learning and Career Development</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>My learning and career reflect both my strengths and weaknesses. Through organization and planning 
                    (and a large degree of luck which presented opportunities,) my career worked out. However, my desire to 
                    be honest meant that I have burned some bridges by being candid.</p>
                    <p>I value community and teamwork, and throughout my career have built highly successful teams which 
                    delivered successful outcomes, to which each member of the team contributed. This is backed by having 
                    good organisation skills and planning the work to be executed.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the strength of delivery also meant that sometimes work took priority over personal life, 
                    when a personal toll is paid by family and friends.</p>

                    <h2>Impact of my Strengths in my Learning Journey and How They Might Intersect with Learning Obstacles</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I consider organisation, perseverance and delivery the most important strengths. Keeping to a deadline will 
                    be important. There is a lot going on in my private life which takes some juggling in order to meet those 
                    requirements as well as my course objectives.</p>
                    <p>There will also be a wealth of experience in online resources and community forums. These, together with the 
                    ability to ask questions, will greatly help in any learning obstacles encountered.</p>

                    <h2>Example from my Experience where I was trying to work productively with others where there was resistance or 
                        tension, and the Strategies I used</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>We were trying to implement a nation-wide publishing system across an organisation with multiple printing presses 
                    in regional hubs. Most knew the current business model cannot be sustained, but none wanted the pain of change. The 
                    strategy is therefore to explain the change and mitigate fears that people have, address their concerns and have a decent 
                    execution process which minimised disruption. This involved ongoing planning, communication and negotiation skills.</p> 
                    <p>Once people knew what was going on and their place in it, they can then decide if they are going to be part of it. 
                    Though there was no real choice, people felt empowered when they are within the process, and we were able to complete 
                    the work.</p>
