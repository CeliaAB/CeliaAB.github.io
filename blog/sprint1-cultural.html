            <h2>The Outcome of an Ethical Situation</h2>
        </span>
        <p>I make ethical decisions all the time, everyday, in the way I live. It can be small things or big things, 
        from how I behave with people to what I do or don't do in life. The outcomes are not always immediate, or 
        measureable. By following the values of integrity, objectivity, community and fairness, and with the knowledge 
        available at the time the decision is made, the outcome is what it is.</p>
        
        <span>
            <h2>My Culture and Its Influence on my Values and Identity</h2>
        </span>
        <p>My original culture values community and what an individual can contribute, rather than the individual. My adopted 
        culture focuses on the individual, so I am conflicted most of the time. I value the individual and what he/she 
        represents, but not at the expense of the community around them.</p>
        <p>In my original culture, success is defined by financial and social standing. In NZ people care about and pursue goals 
        such as work-life balance and self-fulfilment. There is definitely a balance and sometimes you cannot have one without the
        other. It has moved me towards a way of approaching things, as opposed to focussing on outcomes - on "the journey" rather 
        than "the destination".</p>

            <h2>Impact of my Strengths and Limitations in my Learning and Career Development</h2>
        </span>
        <p>My learning and career reflect both my strengths and weaknesses. Through organization and planning (and a large degree 
            of luck which presented opportunities,) my career worked out. However, my desire to be honest meant that I have burned 
            some bridges by being candid.</p>
        <p> I value community and teamwork, and throughout my career have built highly successful teams which delivered successful 
        outcomes, to which each member of the team contributed. This is backed by having good organisation skills and planning the 
        work to be executed.</p>
        <p>In addition, the strength of delivery also meant that sometimes work took priority over personal life, 
        when a personal toll is paid by family and friends.</p>
        

        <span>
            <h2>Impact of my Strengths in my Learning Journey and How They Might Intersect with Learning Obstacles</h2>
        </span>
        <p>I consider organisation, perseverance and delivery the most important strengths. Persevering and keeping to a schedule 
            will be important. There is a lot going on in my private life which takes some juggling in order to meet those 
            requirements as well as my course objectives. In addition, I have not coded in a long time, so to relearn that side 
            of things will be challenging.</p>
        <p>As an adult student coming back into a classroom-type environment, and to be able to work with so many people in my 
            cohort, I will not only need to adapt to a fairly steep learning curve, but also that I am not working solely on my own.</p>
                
        <span>
            <h2>Example from my Experience where I was trying to work productively with others where there was resistance or tension, and the Strategies I used</h2>
        </span>
        <p>My career mainly consisted of leading large scale system change projects. Unless their business is doing projects, companies 
            are not in the business of change, they are in the business of doing business. Every project is a disruption to that business, 
            but kicked off by some need to change, which could be technological, environmental, commercial or any number of reasons. 
            That is, an imperative for change. However, they are still in the business of doing business. As such, every project 
            experiences resistance or tension.</p>
        <p>Also, as immediate managers are evaluated on the performance of their part of the business, it is difficult for them to release 
            good operational staff to projects for two reasons. The first is that businesses rarely have people to spare, so releasing 
            experienced staff to a project means a gap needs to be filled by less experienced personnel. The second is that projects are 
            usually run by non-operational people and are therefore not within the manager's control.</p>
                
        <p>In this environment, large scale change happens.</p>

        <p>The key to effective change is effective communication – probably the single biggest difference between success and failure. 
            People are generally reasonable, very few will resist change when faced with the imperatives that drove that change, 
            and the result that the change will bring.</p>
        <p>Communication includes the definition of the change itself – not only its outcome, but how the change will come about. This is “the plan”.</p>
        <p>The strategy used is therefore define, communicate, communicate, communicate again and get agreement. If you don’t define it, you can’t 
            explain it; if you can’t explain it, you can’t communicate it; if you can’t communicate it, you can’t get agreement on it. It is important 
            to state that agreement is not consensus. It is an agreed outcome from the stakeholders so people can move forward. Quite often, the 
            word “buy-in” is used. I found that that follows agreement. You will never get buy-in when you don’t have agreement.</p>
        <p>I would still use that strategy for large scale change. I really don’t see any alternatives for that magnitude of interruption.</p>
        <p>In the Agile world, there is opportunity to build a product and show the product owner a finished alternative. Kind of 
            make the change happen, then see if it is accepted. A viable alternative for product development, as opposed to enterprise wide change.</p>
        <p>Though communication is after the work is done, it is still needed. </p>
