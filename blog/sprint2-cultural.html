                    <p>Learning Plan Bootcamp</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content">            
                    <p>My overall goal for undertaking the DevAcademy Web Development course is to explore ideas I have for websites and apps 
                        effectively. I understand that there are a lot of self taught people in this field. This was not a realistic avenue 
                        for me. A concise intense learning arena over a limited time period suited my requirements better. I may build a web 
                        development business if I decide that's a path to go down. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The biggest change for me in Bootcamp is likely to be working with other people on individual deliverables. My work up 
                        to now involved big teams, but each person had their own area of responsibility within the 
                        team. Moreover, the environment I worked in was heavily delivery and date focussed.  It had to be due to the sheer 
                        number of people involved and delays were costly. As such, individual's needs were prioritised only in terms of the 
                        due dates. This mindset will need to change for success. In addition, I would like to be more empathetic when working 
                        closely with others and improve my communication skills.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I think the biggest challenge will be staying on top of the material for 9 weeks. I definitely struggled in some of 
                        the javascript coding exercises. But, in addition, there will be requirements for learning tools and other technology 
                        on top of js. It helps to know that some in the cohort will be in exactly the same place. My plan is to participate 
                        as much as possible and get help when I need it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I have no expectations of the bootcamp team other than that they have been through this before and will guide their 
                        charges to successfully completing the course. My own expectation is to show up and come out fairly intact the other 
                        side. I expect that I will have a few days/weeks where tempers are short and my kids will come home to a monster.
                    </p>

                    <p>To manage my workload, I plan to use the onsite time effectively. If there is work that can be done afterhours to 
                        make sure the face time onsite is more productive, I will endeavour to do that as necessary. Should I feel the 
                        workload can't be managed, I will talk with the bootcamp facilitators. If others have been through the course 
                        before and it is achievable, then it is doable for someone else.
                    </p>

                    <p>I still have non-schedulable personal commitments. If they arise I will need to deal with them on a case by case
                        basis.
                    </p>

                <div class="header">
                    <p>Learning Plan Foundations</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content">            
                    <p>My learning plan is to work through the course timely and learn from my own practices and experiences of my cohort. This is 
                        more applicable now as the main cohort has started. I will ask for help when needed, but not until I have looked online for 
                        solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>My personal situation is such that sometimes I will have unexpected calls on my time which will take priority over
                        the course. These are not known in advance, so I will have to adjust as necessary. In any case, I will endeavour to fit the 
                        work in, to meet the due dates that I have committed to.
                    </p>

                    <p>The course appears to have a good many resources, including the internal communication platform(s) and external
                        references and websites. I will make use of these first, and ask for help as necessary.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In the last few weeks, I have observed that people share to varying degrees their work on the course. I have a fairly fixed 
                        mindset as to how I work, and this environment of posting and sharing is not something I am used to. I can see that there 
                        are benefits in doing this. During the course I will incorporate this style of working into my learning approach.
                    </p>

                    <p>In addition, I started the course part time, before most of the cohort started. Now that everyone has started, I plan to work 
                        on campus a couple of days a week which I think will help get to know people and facilitators better. Maybe have a cook-in for 
                        lunch to counter Newmarket prices...
                    </p>

                    <p>I expect courtesy, timeliness and professionalism from the facilitation team. In addition, as they are delivering
                        a service to the students, I expect that service to be delivered. I see this is a collaborative approach.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>As noted earlier, I have personal commitments to family which is non-schedulable. Should this occur during 
                        course time it will take priority over any work. To mitigate this, I expect to have work completed in 
                        advance of due dates where possible.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Before the course, I had the view "I know what I know, and I will learn what I don't know". I still have that view, but perhaps 
                        adding "Somethings I will never know." The goal for me is to learn what I can during the course, and expand that with actually 
                        putting into practice the learnings afterwards.
                    </p>
