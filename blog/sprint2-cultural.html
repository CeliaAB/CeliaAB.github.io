                <div class="content">            
                    <p>I am usually organised and meet delivery schedules. I will ask for help when needed. I usually meet 
                        my commitments. However, my personal situation is such that sometimes I will have unexpected calls 
                        on my time which will take priority over the course.</p>
                    <p>I will fit the work in to meet the due dates that I have committed to. Due to the calls on my time, 
                        this will likely be afterhours with no set hours.</p>
                    <p>I will work with others in a professional and courteous manner, no different than anyone else I have 
                        dealings with.</p>
                    <p>The course appears to have a good many resources, including the internal communication platform(s) and 
                        external references and websites. I will make use of these, and ask for help as necessary.</p>
                    <p>I expect courtesy, timeliness and professionalism from the facilitation team. In addition, as they are 
                        delivering a service to the students, I expect that service to be delivered.</p>
                    <p>As noted earlier, I have personal commitments to family which is non-schedulable. Should this occur during 
                        course time it will take priority over any work. To mitigate this, I expect to have work completed in 
                        advance of due dates where possible.</p>
                    <p>Also, I am overseas for a period of 2 weeks mainly over the course of Sprint 3 (April 10 to April 25). 
                        I expect to complete the work before I go if possible.</p>
