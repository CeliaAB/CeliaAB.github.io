                    <p>My learning plan is to work through the course timely and learn from my own practices and experiences of my cohort. This is 
                        more applicable now as the main cohort has started. I will ask for help when needed, but not until I have looked online for 
                        solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>My personal situation is such that sometimes I will have unexpected calls on my time which will take priority over
                        the course. These are not known in advance, so I will have to adjust as necessary. In any case, I will endeavour to fit the 
                        work in, to meet the due dates that I have committed to.
                    </p>

                    <p>The course appears to have a good many resources, including the internal communication platform(s) and external
                        references and websites. I will make use of these first, and ask for help as necessary.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In the last few weeks, I have observed that people share to varying degrees their work on the course. I have a fairly fixed 
                        mindset as to how I work, and this environment of posting and sharing is not something I am used to. I can see that there 
                        are benefits in doing this. During the course I will incorporate this style of working into my learning approach.
                    </p>

                    <p>In addition, I started the course part time, before most of the cohort started. Now that everyone has started, I plan to work 
                        on campus a couple of days a week which I think will help get to know people and facilitators better. Maybe have a cook-in for 
                        lunch to counter Newmarket prices...
                    </p>

                    <p>I expect courtesy, timeliness and professionalism from the facilitation team. In addition, as they are delivering
                        a service to the students, I expect that service to be delivered. I see this is a collaborative approach.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>As noted earlier, I have personal commitments to family which is non-schedulable. Should this occur during 
                        course time it will take priority over any work. To mitigate this, I expect to have work completed in 
                        advance of due dates where possible.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Before the course, I had the view "I know what I know, and I will learn what I don't know". I still have that view, but perhaps 
                        adding "Somethings I will never know." The goal for me is to learn what I can during the course, and expand that with actually 
                        putting into practice the learnings afterwards.
