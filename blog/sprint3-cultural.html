                <p>What is Emotional Quotient (EQ)?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>EQ is a measure of a person’s emotional intelligence, which is the ability or trait to 
                    perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions. It is derived from answering a number 
                    of questions covering a number of categories including self-awareness, motivation, 
                    empathy and social skills. Different providers have different categories for measurement, 
                    ranging from four to six categories.</p>
                <p>Some providers give a numerical score like 100. Others use a scale for each category like 
                    7.4 out of 10 for self-awareness, and provide an overall score based on the scales, like 9.1.

                <p>How is it different from IQ?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure derived from answering a standardised set of 
                    questions covering short-term memory, analytical thinking, mathematical ability and 
                    spatial recognition, expressed as a score against others in the same age group, normalised 
                    using a distribution with a median of 100 points, with 68% of the scores being between 
                    85 and 115 points.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="header">
              <p>Why is it important?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
                <p>Those with high EQ’s, who can identify their own and others’ emotions and feelings, 
                    and can use this knowledge to communicate and relate to others, and manage emotions to 
                    adapt or achieve goals, are shown to be more successful in certain situations. Examples 
                    given include successful salesmen versus less successful salesmen, successful 
                    business leaders, better grades and achievement scores in school children and so on.</p>

                <p>The course material suggests that EQ is important, but various literature suggests that 
                    things are not so clear cut. There is a link to IQ.</p>

                <p>IQ did not predict success as some factors were never taken into account in the IQ tests. 
                    A study by Angela Lee Duckworth published in 2011 found that IQ tests were measuring much 
                    more than just raw intelligence – they also measure how badly subjects want to succeed on 
                    the test, and later in life. She suggests motivation could be as important to success as 
                    intellectual ability itself. That’s where EQ comes in, as in part it measures 
                    self-motivation.</p>

                <p>EQ is as important as IQ. It is a person’s ability to read situations that involve working with or being around other people, their emotions and feelings. And, 
                    backed by intellectual ability, someone can use their emotional intelligence to adapt and 
                    achieve a desired result.</p>
