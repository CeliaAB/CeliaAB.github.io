                <h3>What is HTML vs CSS?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper<u>t</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage. It is a 
                convention used in digital publication and is not limited to browsers as printing systems
                also use it. The convention specifies how content is structured and the rules surrounding 
                any supplementary information that may be needed in order for the page to work, such as links
                and references.</p>
                <p>CSS stands for <u>C</u>ascading <u>S</u>tyle <u>S</u>heets. It is a set of styling instructions 
                which drive how digital output looks. New styles and parameters are being developed constantly. It
                is used to tell the operating system how the content should look on a page, including any animation
                and other behavior needed, such as changing colour or format when someone hovers over buttons etc.</p>
                <p>One way to look at their differences can be likened to the world of high-end cake decorating!! 
                So, in baking a cake, a bunch of ingredients go into it, gets mixed up in a certain sequence, baked, 
                and out comes a cake. It is limited by the shape of the baking container, the inherent constraints
                of the right temperature, and time. You can add decorations to it, glace or ice it, but it
                is essentially what comes out of the oven. There's only so much that can be done to it. However,
                 its why we buy cakes to eat. The content. That's HTML.</p>
                <p>In the work of high-end cake decorating, the magicians are the cake decorators. They take the 
                baked product, then cut, stack, shape, join, mold, wrap and colour it. They add embellishments, put 
                it in fantastic packaging including mobiles, and transform the humble cake into a work of art, 
                visually appealing as well as hopefully being still edible. That's CSS.</p>
                <p>In that world, as well as the digital world, there are instances where the style is what is being
                consumed. There are web sites that only has style content and people visit them. However, generally 
                people want content - they want cake.</p>

                <h3>Control Flows and Loops</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Web pages are used for many reasons, to facilitate information sharing and the collection of
                information; to enable financial transactions in ecommerce; to validate inputs such as testing and so 
                on. The input and output of information sometimes require it to be processed in a specific way, like
                filling a shopping cart online then paying for it; or getting dates to enable a travel booking.</p>
                <p>A human being uses logic and reasoning to do these types of tasks. For example, to wash a car You
                may need to fill a bucket, get the tools then wash the car. He/she can tell if the bucket is full. A 
                machine needs to be programmed to determine if a set of criteria has been met for it to execute the next
                step. If bucket = full AND tools = ready THEN ready to wash car. This sequencing is a control flow.</p>
                <p>Control flows is the way machines are told how to operate. If "a" happened, only then can the next 
                step "b" be taken. So in ecommerce, an example may be that until payment is received, items 
                in someone's shopping cart cannot be pushed to the picking process.</p>
                <p>A loop is a repeat of a step until everything that needs that step has been done. An example of this 
                is washing dishes manually. You have to repeat the washing effort for all the dirty items until everything
                has been washed. In the machine world, using the shopping example above, once someone has paid, the items
                must be moved from the shopping basket to the "paid" section of the webpage, as well as the back office 
                functions of the picking queues until there are no more items left in the shopping basket. The 
                process is repeated in a loop until the finish condition has been met.</p>

                <h3>What is the DOM? (Beethoven's 5th Symphony playing in the background...)</h3>
            </div>
          <div class="content">
                <p>The <u>D</u>ocument <u>O</u>bject <u>M</u>odule is an interface provided by browser vendors so that people
                can see all the information related to how a website works using a highly structured view. The representation is 
                called a tree because it has a tree-like structure, albeit an upside down tree, with every item or element on a website 
                being a node that may have parents or children depending on where it sits in that tree structure.</p>
                <p>Because it is an interface showing a built webpage, its a good tool for developers to use to immediately
                see modifications made to a page. Changes are made to the DOM but the live page is not impacted by these changes.
                They only work on that person's device. You can test different scenarios by running the changes through and 
                see right away if things behave as they should after the change. Adjustments can be made then saved to the 
                live code.</p>

                <h3>Are There Differences in Getting Data from Arrays versus Objects?</h3>
            </div>
          <div class="content">
                <p>(This relates to JS only). An array is a grouping of similar elements using a single variable. For example,
                different makes of cars may be grouped by the variable <i>cars</i>. Arrays can have numbers or strings.</p>
                <p>In JS, almost everything is an object - an entity with a collection of properties that define their characteristics, 
                like the number of wheels or the colour for the cars example. (An array is an object in JS but is normally referred to 
                as an array.) Data in objects can have multiple properties.</p>
                <p>There 2 ways to get data from objects (and arrays). These are dot "." or bracket "[]".</p>
                <p>Other than it being simpler, the dot is used when you can specify the name of the object and the property you are
                looking for, as in objectName.propertyName. It has a number of limitations in that the property name (or "identifier") 
                must be alphanumeric but can include "_" or "$", cannot start with a number, and cannot contain variables.</p>
                <p>The second method, brackets, is used when the property name or identifier contains data that won't work with dot 
                method, such as if there are spaces or other special characters in the property identifier other than "_" or "$", or 
                if its a variable. It takes the form objectName["propertyName"].</p>
                <p>Because arrays are sequentially indexed sets of data, there is another way of accessing data from arrays.</p>
                Each item in an array has a corresponding index of where it sits in the array. The first item in an array has an index 
                of 0, and the last item has an index of the total number of items in the array, less one.  So using brackets because 
                the identifier starts with a number, you can actually get the data you need by calling on the item in its particular 
                sequence in the array. If the cars array has ("Ford", "Chevrolet", "Lexus"), asking for cars[0] in an operation will 
                get Ford as the answer. (The index starts at 0 because it uses offsets to identify where the data sits. The first data 
                element has no offset, so it starts at 0). However, this still sits within the parameters for brackets to be used to 
                access data.</p>

                <h3>Functions and Why they are Useful</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A function in JS is a procedure that performs a task, such as look for something, compares something, performs
                a calculation on something. Without functions there is no way of interacting with the data. As such, they are 
                necessary.  Also, so much is performed by the front-end including data validation, selection of different options 
                etc. If required information is vetted at the time of input, backend processes will have better data for processing, 
                enabling error rates to drop. For example, if there are set dates that an event has to occur, a function can be used 
                to test whether an date input fits within these limits. To leave this further down in the process will mean additional 
                intervention or validation.</p>
