            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        </span>
        <p>I am usually organised and meet delivery schedules. I will ask for help when needed. I usually meet my commitments. 
            However, my personal situation is such that sometimes I will have unexpected calls on my time which will take priority over
            the course.</p>
        <p>I will fit the work in to meet the due dates that I have committed to.</p>
        <p>I will work with others in a professional and courteous manner, no different than anyone else I have dealings with.</p>
        <p>The course appears to have a good many resources, including the internal communication platform(s) and external
            references and websites. I will make use of these, and ask for help as necessary.</p>
        <p>I expect courtesy, timeliness and professionalism from the facilitation team. In addition, as they are delivering
            a service to the students, I expect that service to be delivered.</p>
        <p>As noted earlier, I have personal commitments to family which is non-schedulable. Should this occur during course time
            it will take priority over any work. To mitigate this, I expect to have work completed in advance of due dates where
            possible.</p>
        <p>Also, I am overseas for a period of 2 weeks mainly over the course of Sprint 3 (April 10 to April 25). I expect to 
            complete the work before I go if possible.</p>

                <p>Neuroplasticity</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>People are not born with a fixed set of abilities. Time and again, we see evidence that people - their lives - can change, 
                    and be changed, by circumstance, environment, culture and so on. To change, there must be an ability to change. The course 
                    material and online references show that this change happens continuously as the brain is learning new things all the time, 
                    adapting to the new environment to meet our needs. The patient recovering from a head injury forms new skills or "relearns" 
                    old ones, under new conditions. Andrei Agassi said his father put a tennis racquet into his six month old hands in the crib!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The premise of neuroplasticity is that your brain is changing by making new connections continuously. The saying "Practice 
                    Makes Perfect" means that with constant application or use, the task at hand is performed with more precision, accuracy, 
                    efficiency or whatever it needs to be, so we get better at doing it when done over and over again. However, just repetition 
                    may mean something done wrong is perfected, so the saying may be better expressed by "Perfect Practice Makes Perfect" - with 
                    modifications to the repeated task to make repititions "ideal" and more accurate - the dart player, the MLB batter, the student
                    learning javascript...
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the brain is learning all the time, no-one is stuck doing one thing or being one thing. Once people understand that they can
                    change in a meaningful way, it just becomes a matter of time, rather than a matter of the inevitable. An empowering thought indeed.
                </p>

                <p>I found this interesting when researching neuroplasticity: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiTz2i4VHFw">How your brain works</a></p>

                <p>Growth Mindset</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Growth Mindset is the understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed. This is opposed to a Fixed Mindset, where 
                    people believe abilities are fixed and cannot be developed. There is no point in learning if we believe that we cannot learn or 
                    master new things. 
                </p>

                <p>One of the interesting things about a Growth Mindset is that the learning process becomes a priority rather than the outcome. 
                    Because learning is a journey, it means that time spent on the process is actually worthwhile. The results are just part of the
                    process and you are actually looking for changes in the results every time you go through. 
                </p>

                <p>I found this useful when researching Growth Mindset: <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">Decades of Scientific Research 
                    that Started a Growth Mindset Revolution

              <p>Impact on Learning Plan</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
                <p>The biggest impact on my learning plan is to approach it as a journey - to view the outcomes as being less important than the process.
                    It doesn't necessarily change the plan, but it may change my focus whilst doing the course.
