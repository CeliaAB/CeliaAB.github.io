                <h3>The Pains of Blockage</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I just went through Sprint 4, which focusses mainly on using javascript to solve a number of 
                    challenges. I say "went through" rather than "completed" as there are still a few wrinkles I
                    need to work out.
                </p>
                <p>An example of this is the super FizzBuzz challenge in the 3rd kata. The logic was relatively simple
                     - certain numbers meeting certain conditions are replaced with the words Fizz or Buzz or both. 
                     However, I tried to define the data in one go, because it should be able to be done, and ended 
                     up spending alot of time on this. I looked at syntax online and in the various chats and sample 
                     solutions, and lastly asked someone for help.
                </p>
                <p> I feel that this type of problem will reduce as time goes on as there are only a set number of ways
                    you can define things, but it is frustrating when the wheels are just spinning.

                <h3>An Elegant Solution</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Also, we had to return modified arrays which capitalized words. Rather than looking at the
                    first letter of each word, its much easier to look at the first letter of every string, which I find
                    far more elegant. There are a number of built in methods that have been written for javascript which
                    developers can make use of, which not only makes coding easier, but it simplifies the code as well 
                    since the logic is "behind the scenes". In this instance, it is to split the string up then look 
                    at each resulting word.
                </p>
                <p>To find how to do this, it was a matter of framing questions online and reviewing the results to see 
                    what methods have been written about. I feel that there is so much body of work out there the the 
                    right question will yield the desired result, which is also the takeaway from both these situations.

                <h3>Problem Solving Techniques and Levels of Confidence</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>There are a number of suggested problem solving techniques that were introduced during this Sprint. A 
                    number of them are just commonsense, such as trying something, reading error messages, "Googling" or 
                    looking for help online, and asking for help. In addition, using Pseudocode was introduced, as was talking
                    to an inanimate object like a rubber duck.
                </p>
                <p>Pseudocode is very useful in defining in overall terms something new. You can see right away if 
                    the end-to-end process has been defined, making sure the major parts have been considered. This may be less 
                    useful when someone has already done work and another problem solving technique maybe more appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>Also, talking to an inanimate object may clarify one's thinking, but so could brainstorming with peers or 
                    coaches. It really is case by case, and also depends somewhat on the availability of say other people, online 
                    resources and so on.
                </p>
                <p>With regards to reflection, I am of the opinion that you are constantly reflecting, on work, life, relationship 
                    and so on. It is not so much a problem solving technique as a living technique. 
                </p>
                <p>I feel confident in using any of them, though some stand out as being more useful than others, intuitively. I 
                    think each has its place, especially since some are going to take more time than others, or involve more 
                    interactions with people than others. When to use each will depend on circumstance.
