        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This Sprint introduced a number of concepts to set the groundwork for Foundations. Topics such as thinking like a 
                developer, looking at individual identity and values, and introducing yourself to the ether and why you are on 
                the course were covered. The central theme, if there can be one from these fairly broad areas, is that there is 
                more to web development than coding.  
            </p>
            <p>I found the material thought-provoking and interesting. However, the authors and contributors come from certain 
                perspectives, and provide labels that are somewhat simplistic as to what people's values are, or the approach to 
                problem solving and so on. Work and social environments are such complex places because there are other people 
                involved. It was a good introduction into self awareness and the bigger picture.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The concept of a Learning Plan was introduced in this Sprint. The idea is that to be successful, an individual has to 
                take ownership of his/her own learning, and actually have thought through how to approach it successfully when its 
                done. Everyone had to come with with what the plan is, how it will be followed, barriers to success and any known risks
                or impediments. The people taking the course are put into cohorts - going through the program on a set schedule with set 
                outcomes, and they make commitments to the program as well as each other. Each individual's Learning Plan makes sure 
                that these outcomes are achievable in a timely manner for the group to succeed in the program.
            </p>
            <p>It was useful to write down my plan once I understood how Foundations is taught. To articulate my approach allowed me to
                show the ownership I have taken for completing the program. Also, as I have outside commitments it was a good place to 
                let people know.
            </p>

        <div class="header">
            <p>Sprint 3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Emotional Intelligence was introduced in this Sprint. Web developers are problem solvers in an environment 
                that is constantly changing, in terms of technological advances, changes in business practices and 
                marketplace demands. The individual has to be mentally engaged to deliver. And because it is a project 
                environment, often, developers work on one-off pieces of work then move onto other pieces of work. 
                Understanding and cultivating emotional intelligence is important to adapt and deliver.
            </p>
            <p>I found this section interesting too, particularly the active listening part. It highlighted for me the 
                need to listen more as communication doesn't just mean sharing information and ideas. Sometimes, its 
                about letting others say what they need to. 
            </p>

        <div class="header">
            <p>Sprint 4</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset was introduced in this Sprint. Web developers come from all walks of life. 
                People that take the course may not have done any development before. The idea is that though things may be 
                difficult, it is just a matter of time and practice to be successful if people have a growth mindset.
            </p>                        
            <p>It definitely helps when you are new to something to understand that progress is not measured by successfully
                completing the work, but by learning how to do the work. The calculator challenge definitely was a road trip 
                with many loops and stops on the way.

            <p>Overall Journey</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I found the material engaging and learnt something new, as well as somethings about myself and my prejudices and 
                predispositions which I need to focus on.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, I found switching modes between the technical parts of the course and the core material jarring at 
                first, but towards the end of Sprint 5 it was a welcomed interlude!
